## Overview
A novel approach to improve Amyloid quantification and address partial volume effect (PVE) in PET using MRI-guided super-resolution with latent diffusion model. The diffusion model is trained on synthetic data simulated from real MRI scans using PET imaging physics.

### Qualitative Results

This repository contains:

- An inference script `./generate.py` to synthesize high-resolution FBP scans given an input low-resolution FBP scan and matching T1w MRI scan.
- Trained model checkpoints in `./checkpoints` and a sample FBP and T1w MRI scan `./samples` directory.
- Training scripts in `./src` to train modality-specific AutoEncoderKL (compression) models and a latent diffusion model (LDM) for super-resolution.

## 🛠️ Requirements and Installation
* Python >= 3.10
* Pytorch == 2.4.1
* CUDA Version >= 12.6
You can use LDMRR.yaml to create the conda environment. Or you can use requirements.txt to install the used packages. 
```
conda env remove --name ldmrr python=3.10 -y
conda activate ldmrr
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Instructions to install MONAI can also be found [here](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/installation.html) and the appropriate version of Pytorch using [locally](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/installation.html).

## Dataset
You should structure your dataset in the following way, where `images` contain low-resolution images, `mrs` contain matching MRI scans and `targets` contain ground-truth high-resolution scans (digital phantoms here). For an example checkout `./src/spdp_fbp` folder. All modality images are 256x256x256 in dimensions (sample images for reference in `./src/sample` directory).

```
## Inference
Training and inference scripts are in `./src` folder. Sample inputs `./sample` and generated outputs `./results` are also provided.  
```bash
python3 generate.py --input_folder ./sample --output_folder ./results
```

## Training 
To train the compression models:  
```bash
python3 train_autoencoderKL.py --dataset /path/to/data --modality sp --epochs 60 --batch_size 2 
```
Use modality = [sp, dp, or mr] to train models for simulated PET (low-res), digital phantom (high-res), and MRI (high-res), respectively. 

For training the latent diffusion model:
```bash
python3 train_ldm_fbp_sp2dp.py --dataset /path/to/data --modality sp --epochs 60 --batch_size 2 
```
